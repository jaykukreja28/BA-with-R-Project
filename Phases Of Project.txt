What is a Prediction model in ML?
Depicting the future based on the past data we have
Prediction models rely on patterns and trends observed in historical data.
By analyzing past behavior, these models identify regularities and relationships
that can be used to predict future outcomes.

------------
Steps to build a Predictive Model

1) Collect and Organize the Data
Step Completed
2) Clean the Dataset (clean, transform, and prepare your raw data for modeling)
3) Choose an Algorithm/model
Determine if a Regression or Classification MOdel suits the classification.
Regression - If Numerical Output is needed of a specific variable 
Classification - What class or category a data point belongs to output karna ho toh

4) Build the model
-----------------------------------


1) Data Collection and Exploration:
Import your dataset into R and Explore using head/summary and
visualize it using packages like ggplot2
2) Data Preprocessing
->Handling Missing Values
->Encoding Categorical Variables
	(Feature Engineering and selection)
->Feature Scaling/Normalization
->Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to capture more information from the data.
->Handling Outliers
->Data Sampling
->Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the number of features in the dataset while preserving most of the important information. 
3) Splitting Data:
Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate your model's performance.
You can use functions like createDataPartition() from caret or sample() to split the
data randomly.
4) Model Selection:
Choose an appropriate algorithm for your problem (e.g., linear regression, decision trees,
random forests, support vector machines, neural networks).
Train multiple models and compare their performance using techniques like 
cross-validation or grid search.

5) Model Training:
Use the training dataset to fit your chosen model. This typically involves 
using functions like lm() for linear regression, randomForest() for random forests,
svm() for support vector machines...etc.

6)Model Evaluation:
Evaluate your model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics
(e.g., mean squared error for regression, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
for classification).

7) Visualize performance metrics using functions like confusionMatrix() 
from the caret package or plotting libraries like ggplot2.

8) Model Tuning:

Fine-tune your model's hyperparameters to improve performance using techniques 
like grid search or random search.

9) Model Deployment:
deploy it for predictions on new data
